# What You Need

in this directory you should find a firmware: 
- openwrt-ar71xx-generic-gl-ar150-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

Upgrade the AR150 with that firmware

This time around i've also included some modules and packages which are
included in the packages directory. I've not made them so they can just be
repositories for the openwrt router, but if you find you need anything and
its not in the base build, you might find it here, but you need to manually
install via the cli.
