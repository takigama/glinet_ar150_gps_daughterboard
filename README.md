## Update - 2020, Mar 9

I've been running my little guys for 3 years now. I have two in outdoor cases
being powered over ethernet and they have yet to skip a beat, which is suprising.
As some of you may know, Australia (especially NSW) has been going through
some hard times this summer. First it was an amazing heatwave followed by fire
Then it was floods and intense rain. They endured both. Going up against two
RPI's (both RPI's died in the heat), thats doing pretty well.

I've now added a 2020 firmware release which is based on 19.07.2. This time
i've included all the packages as well and made as many modules as would
compile. If you do need any extra modules, they should now already be available

I've not chaned the firmware to point here for packages however, so you need
to grab them manually.

I also plan on publishing a build guide for the external cases, hopefully
some time soon.

## What be it?

Simple daughter board for the AR150 from GL.inet using the Quectel L80 GPS or
the MTK3339 GPS (there are boards for either)

... and its AWESOME!!!!

... and NOW with added linuxptp AND LEDE support!!!!!

note that it doesnt come configured with much, so most of the daemons included
(ntp, chrony, etc) start up automatically with defaults, you want to change
that

## Why?

meh, why not?

Seriously though, some time ago I used the predessesor of the AR150 and the
uBlox Neo 6m GPS receiver to build a NTP with GPS and PPS for high accuracy
timing. [See here](http://pjrlost.blogspot.com.au/2015/09/ar9331-pps-gps-ntp-awesome.html)
I had to write some code to enable PPS interupt based processing on the AR9331
family (thanks to some code that already supported GPIO's with interrupts)
and was fairly impressed with the results. At home its the prefered clock
source, going up against a RPI1, RPI2 and a Wyse terminal with a serial port
which runs an AMD geode cpu.

Sadly its hard to get the Neo uBlox 6M in an SMD format, but I stumbled onto
the Quectel L80 chip, which is easy to aquire and even smaller than the uBlox. The AR150
has different GPIO pins to the original GL.inet router I had in my previous
project (which is still actually running at home and still out-performing
most other GPS/PPS's i've built).

A number of projects do use the AR9331 as a GPS/PPS/NTP clock, but this was
the first one that I know of that implemented by the gpio interrupt mechanism
(which is more accurate and more efficient).

## How?

Well, first go print a board at oshpark [here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Jt3Wxv2q)
and then go get a Quectel L80 chip (just the chip, no board), a couple of leds
a small mosfet (dont really need it to be honest) and a few resistors and lastly
of course a AR150.

Solder it all together, then sit back and wait for me to port my code on the
blog to the AR150 (only have to change the PPS pin from 13 to 14), or compile
the code yourself and figure that bit out.

Also, when i started this, i was thinking along the lines of the PoE version
of the AR150 (so the AR150 can sit outside in a silicon case with the GPS poking
upward thru the top - i'll post pic's when I build it)

Dont let the SMD scare you, plenty of youtubes up for how to hand solder or heat
gun solder this thing. I use a head gun for everything except the GPS module. I
use a soldering iron for the GPS module.

## BOM

1) 1 x L80 GPS Module or MTK3339 Module
2) 1 x Mosfet (BSS138 or similar) - optional, allows GPS to be power cycled by board
3) 3 x 200ohm 0805 SMD resistors
4) 1 x 2x5 90 degree angled pin header
5) 3 x 0805 leds (colour is up to you)


## GPIO's

So in the project, its using two GPIO's. One is used to turn the GPS itself on
and off. The other is used for the PPS interrupt. GPIO 17 is the power switch
GPIO 14 will be the PPS pin.

## Updates

3/Mar/2018 - There are now two firmwares sitting in the firmware directory. This
update moves my repo from its very-alpha state to something I now consider to be
relatively tested and working fairly stable and as such is now considered beta!

The baords have both beeen tested with fairly good success so far. I would
slightly recommend the L80 GPS over the MTK3339 GPS module as it seems more
sensative and less jittery.

Heres some Pics for you:

L80:

MTK3339:

Theres no alot to distinguish between the two except they have different footprints
on the GPS module
